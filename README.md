# Final-Project

## Content

* Selected Topic - What variable are most important in predicted IMDB movie scores in a machine learning model.
* Reason why we selected topic - There is alot of discussion with which variables play a role in the IMDB movie rating scores. We wanted to create a model that supports a deciding factor.
* Descirption of Source of Data - Both or ur movie data sources were downloaded from Kaggle.
* Question we hope to answer with the date - Whate factor influences the IMDB movie score the most.

## Communication Protocals
* We will be using zoom, slack, and github to communicate.



## Decide on a topic for the projectâ€”think of a question that can be answered using data.
       
    We want to predict the IMDB user rating score using the data provided in the CSV.

##  Reminders : 
 * Do we know how our model tells the story with the Data?
 
 * What Kind of Message will the dashboard display?
