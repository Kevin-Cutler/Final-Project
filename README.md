# Final-Project

## Content

* Selected Topic - What variable are most important in predicted IMDB movie scores in a machine learning model.
* Reason why we selected topic - There is a lot of discussion with which variables play a role in the IMDB movie rating scores. We wanted to create a model that supports a deciding factor.
* Description of Data sources - Both our movie data sources were downloaded from Kaggle.
* Question we hope to answer with the data - What factor influences the IMDB movie score the most.

## Communication Protocals
* We will be using zoom, slack, and github to communicate.



## Decide on a topic for the projectâ€”think of a question that can be answered using data.
       
    We want to predict the IMDB user rating score using the data provided in the CSV.
    

## Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.
Done


## Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
Done

## Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
 TBD
## Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.
TBD


 
##  Reminders : 
* Do we know how our model tells the story with the Data?
* What Kind of Message will the dashboard display?
