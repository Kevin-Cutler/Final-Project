# What variables are most important in predicting IMDB movie scores in a machine learning model?

## Reason behind the Topic
There is alot of discussion with which variables play a role in the IMDB movie rating scores. We wanted to create a model that supports a deciding factor using two data sources from Kaggle what factor influences the IMDB movie score the most.

## Communication Protocals
We will be using zoom, slack, and github to communicate.

    

## Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.

## Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
Done

## Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
 Done
## Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.

##  Reminders : 
 * Do we know how our model tells the story with the Data?
 
 * What Kind of Message will the dashboard display?
